"comment_text": "I hope all IRL is OK or will be for your sake. Hope it's not the current fucked up economy or anything else more serious. I've come to like you as a person. Even if you don't come back here, I'll think of you when the Twins/Yankees play one another next season Sad to think you almost wish people left for Wiki drama shit than for IRL shit. *HUGS* Sounds weird but feels right. You know where to find me and the others should you be looking. "
